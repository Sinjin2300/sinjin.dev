I've been meaning to make a blog for a while now and now that I've **graduated** and visited **Japan** I have the time to sit down and make one. I'm not sure entirely what I'm going to post on this yet and it almost certainly will change form from now but I just needed to write something down so that I could adjust the site. I'm generating a static site using **Hugo** and hosting the content on **GitHub Pages** to avoid any friction with webhosting.  
<br>
Here is a video I shot on my walk to see some **Japanese Macaques** early in the morning. I love the fog and the trees, it was absolutely serene. (I wanted to test video embeds)
<video controls width="640">
  <source src="/videos/monkeywalk.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<br>
Now here is a code block with some rust code!
```Rust
pub fn foo() -> &'static str {
    "bar"
}
```

<br>

This should serve well enough as a test/introductory post. However sparse this may be, it will help me get over the issue of making a first step. I will no longer wonder about what to write as my first post to make some sort of meaningful statement or set some high expectation.
<br>
Also, this site has an **[RSS feed](/en/blog/index.xml)** for those of you cool enough to use that.
